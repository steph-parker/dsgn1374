		<p>You are the girl with a <span class="big-bold">black heart</span></p>

		<p><span class="angled">You are the stars, you are the girl with a bright light</span></p>

		<p><span class="big-sceww">I see it shine</span></p>

		<p><span class="vertical">You find yourself wrapped up in a black art, you bear the scars</span></p>

		<p><span class="shadow">You are the girl with a black heart</span></p>

		<p><span class="vertical-2">I watch your sun set</span></p>

		<p><span class="transparent">And then you lift the moon into a sky on fire, and the colours that you choose, to court and spark, to ignite the dark</span></p>

		<p><span class="idk">Burning up in the bright light of your black heart, you shake the cold off of your shoulders, your bones harden in the breeze</span></p>

		<p><span class="other-font">Billowing smoke</span></p>

		<p><span class="color-block">white ghosts are bowed ribbons through the shivering leave, you breathe a big wind</span></p>

		<p><span class="transparent">You sing of ice and snow</span></p>

		<p><span class="big-bold">Shutting up them hungry dogs, you come and bury them bones, you bathe them bright white in the shadows</span></p>

		<p><span class="vertical-2">Burning up in the bright light of your black heart</span></p>

		<p><span class="big-boi">And I want you to believe</span></p>

		<p><span class="vertical-3">everything that I say</span></p>

		<p><span class="shadow-2">And the beauty of a black heart is the light shining through</span></p>

		<h1>And the light is you</h1>

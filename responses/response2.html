			<p>“In the early 60s, many years before the first Apple personal computer, a young thinker Ted Nelson, had his own ideas about creating a computer network. The web as we know it took a different route, but Nelson’s ideas are still dormant.”</p>

			<p><span class="response">I’ve never heard of Ted Nelson. Wonder what his ideas were?</span></p>

			<p>“I must have been five years old. I was trailing my hand in the water and I thought about how the water was moving around my fingers, opening on one side and closing on the other, and that changing system of relationships…”</p>

			<p><span class="response">That’s actually crazy how he thought of that. You have to be such a genius to come up with revolutionary ideas in that way. It’s insane how ideas can come from literally anywhere. You never know what will spark something brilliant.</span></p>

			<p>“In today’s computers they betrayed that because there’s no decent system for cut and paste and they changed the meaning of the words cut and paste and pretended it was the same thing…”</p>

			<p><span class="response">So you’re telling me cut and paste doesn’t mean cut and paste? Like what else would it mean? Why is ctrl+x and ctrl+v not a decent system?? And if there was another meaning, why would changing it be bad? Usually technological changes are for the better.</span></p>

			<p>Ted Nelson explains his way of connecting sources to their linked content [2:29]</p>

			<p><span class="response">Looks interesting. It’s smart to be able to highlight a part of a page and have the source page open up next to it. It’s cool how you can see all the source pages lined up, kinda reminds me of having a bunch of artboards open in Illustrator. Some of them are quite long though, so it’s not as pleasing to look at. I can also kinda see why it never materialized. Although it seems like a good idea, having normal links to sources at the bottom of a page seems good enough. It gets the job done. Not sure how elaborate his concept is, but from what I can see, I don’t think everyone wants to see where all the sources are every time they go to a website. The sources don’t need to be super accessible for like at least 70% of the people visiting the site.</span></p>

			<p>“If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again…I don’t want to be remembered as the guy who didn’t.”</p>

			<p><span class="response">Commendable. He’s sticking to what he believes in. If he wants to continue with this concept and keep improving it, then by all means. Everyone should do what makes them happy and feel fulfilled. I agree with what he says. Try and try again. On the other hand, at some point you should know when to quit. I think in his situation though, keep going.</span></p>

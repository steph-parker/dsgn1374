		<h2>The Crystal Goblet</h2>

			<p>“You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.”</p>

			<p><span class="response">Very interesting.. I feel like not everyone cares about the sensation of drinking out of something that costs a lot of money though.. Like, I don’t really. I’m not a huge fan of wine so either of the goblets wouldn’t be very satisfying to me. The gold one has exquisite patterns however, making it more visually pleasing to look at compared to the clear goblet. So they’re right, someone who doesn’t care about wine isn’t going to care what they’re drinking it out of.</span></p>

			<p>“…almost all the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography… When a goblet has a base that looks too small for security, it does not matter how cleverly it is weighted; you feel nervous lest it should tip over.”</p>

			<p><span class="response">Yes, that’s true. The structure of letters and words can be compared to objects in real life. As humans, I think we’re always kinda looking for balance and structure. Even if something is standing up right but looks like it’ll tip over at any second, this makes us uneasy. We can play with the structure of letterforms to evoke different feelings like this.</span></p>

			<p>“If books are printed in order to be read, we must distinguish readability from what the optician would call legibility…A public speaker is more 'audible' in that sense when he bellows. But a good speaking voice is one which is inaudible as a voice.”</p>

			<p><span class="response">Good point to keep in mind. Readability is not the same as legibility. Legibility relates to the ability to distinguish one glyph from another. Often, when the x-height is taller, the typeface is more legible. The readability is controlled moreso by the designer, it includes things like type case, line spacing, line length etc.</span></p>

			<p>“I said something about what artists think about a certain problem, and he replied with a beautiful gesture: 'Ah, madam, we artists do not think---we feel!'”</p>

			<p><span class="response">So I get what he’s saying, I think artists are different to graphic designers though. Artists certainly create with feelings, but graphic designers have to think in order to find a visual solution. Thinking is a key part of the process, so to dismiss that entirely doesn’t make sense to me.</span></p>

			<p>“Our subconsciousness is always afraid of blunders (which illogical setting, tight spacing and too-wide unleaded lines can trick us into), of boredom, and of officiousness. The running headline that keeps shouting at us, the line that looks like one long word, the capitals jammed together without hair-spaces---these mean subconscious squinting and loss of mental focus.”</p>

			<p><span class="response">I definitely relate to this. Sometimes when you look at a design, you can’t focus because your brain fixates on these little things that make it difficult to read. I typically am a pretty slow reader and lose my focus a lot. I hadn’t considered that maybe part of it is because of my subconscious getting lost in these blunders. That certainly might be part of it. But I’m always thinking. Even while watching movies, I notice one thing in the movie and fixate on it, then zone out, thinking of so many other things.</span></p>

		<h1>An Interview with Amanda Burns</h1>

		<p class="date">Sunday, November 9, 2020</p>

		<p class="q">Stephanie: What part of design do you enjoy the most and why?</p>

		<p class="a">Amanda: I enjoy illustration and taking my illustrations and being able to print them in a useful matter, or just being able to hold my final product.

		<p class="q">S: What got you first interested in design and when?</p>

		<p class="a">A: I've always had an interest in art, but in grade 11 I did a screen-printing project and that's when I found a love for print.</p>

		<p class="q">S: What are you hoping to do with design once you graduate from NC?</p>

		<p class="a">A: I hope to work in a print shop that does screen printing, maybe do a bit of free-lance but I'm not sure yet.</p>

		<p class="q">S: What aspects make a website functional and pleasing to look at?</p>

		<p class="a">A: I think readability and spacing, along with a creative element to make it pop/interesting to look at makes it functional.</p>

		<p class="q">S: How important do you think having a well designed website is for a business and why?</p>

		<p class="a">A: I think it's very important, especially in today's society where most things are now online. Having a functional website might be your only way to get your name or product out (especially with Covid lockdown).</p>

		<p class="q">S: What is your favourite and least favourite part about web design?</p>

		<p class="a">A: My favourite part would be designing a layout and applying images. My least favourite would be the html because it's a learning curve and takes a while to get the hang of it.</p>
